        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Jodi and Jared’s story begins in the fall of 2008 at the University of Maryland. Jodi was living off campus with a few of her AOPi sorority sisters. Three doors away, Jared was in a similar situation with a group of his Lambda Chi fraternity brothers. While their paths crossed multiple times throughout that fall thanks to close mutual friends, they wouldn’t truly meet until November. During a trip into DC for Jared’s birthday, Jodi and Jared officially met for the first time. The two felt an instant connection, discovered they had much in common, and became fast friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their friendship grew throughout the remainder of college as well as the summer that followed Jodi’s graduation, during which the two frequented the outdoor pool on campus and the college park bars. In August of 2009, Jodi moved to Manhattan for graduate school, while Jared remained in College Park to finish his degree. They remained close friends, albeit from a distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In March 2010, Jared finally left College Park and moved up to Hoboken, NJ. Once again, Jared and Jodi found themselves in close proximity of one another. They often got together for lunch or coffee, and spent countless nights out together in New York City. Jared even crashed on Jodi’s couch a few times when he was too tired to make the trip back to Hoboken after a late night out. Although they were very close, their relationship remained platonic until Memorial Day weekend of 2011. On Sunday, May 29th, the two shared their first kiss at 230 Fifth- a rooftop bar with an incredible view of the Empire State Building. After that, it was clear to both Jared and Jodi that they were destined to be much more than “just friends,” and things moved very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two began officially dating on July 18th, 2011, when Jared sent Jodi a text message that read: “be my gf?” while she was away on a girls’ weekend in Ocean City, Maryland. Jodi was more than happy to oblige!
            </p>
            <p>
                One year later, Jared and Jodi moved into an apartment in the East Village together. Things continued to get better and better as the two fell deeper in love and their lives became enmeshed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In February of 2014, Jared and Jodi traveled to Cancun, Mexico with Vanessa, Amit, Maeve, and Rob. After an early birthday dinner for Jodi at Puerto Madero, a restaurant on the water, Jared asked her to take a walk outside. He led her out onto the dock, dropped to one knee, presented a gorgeous ring, and asked Jodi to marry him. She could barely hold back her tears as she said yes! The newly engaged couple spent the rest of the week celebrating with great friends and toasting to their future together.
